git how to merge your branch (mybranch) with master 
and continue working on it 

Here is the process you are looking for:

    git checkout master			// checkout master
    git merge mybranch			// merge mybranch to master
    git push origin master		// 
    git branch -d mybranch		// delete mybranch
    git checkout master			// checkout master
    git checkout -b mybranch	// create a new mybranch from master and checkout 
	
    continue your commits on the branch Farmcrops...

Branches are just pointers, it's very easy to create/delete a branch and if your branch Farmcrops isn't pushed on remote repository, there is absolutely no dependency with it. You can delete it after the merge and recreate it from the master.

Hope this will help you.
